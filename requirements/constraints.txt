# Constraining this since we haven't handled newer versions of Django Rest Framework
# and we want to allow edx-platform to update this separately.
djangorestframework==3.9.4

# zipp 2.0.0 requires Python >= 3.6
zipp==1.0.0

# We expect v2.0.0 to introduce large breaking changes in the feature toggle API
edx-toggles<2.0.0
